#### LibTDE
Library to calculate time delay between two synchronized audio streams.

Four different methods:
<ol>
<li>Cross correlation (CC)</li>
<li>Average square difference (ASDF)</li>
<li>Phase transform (PHAT)</li>
<li>Peak detection (PEAK)</li>
</ol>

First three methods also have a stepwise version of the function (..._Step) to enable calculation cancellation.
